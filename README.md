The domain `manager.assets.ubuntu.com` [is now redirected by the assets.ubuntu.com service](https://github.com/canonical/assets.ubuntu.com/blob/main/konf/site.yaml#L58) to assets.ubuntu.com/manager and the manager [is served entirely](https://github.com/canonical/assets.ubuntu.com/blob/main/webapp/routes.py#L36) from that application.

This app is no longer used.

# Assets manager
[![CircleCI build status](https://circleci.com/gh/canonical-web-and-design/manager.assets.ubuntu.com.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/canonical-web-and-design/manager.assets.ubuntu.com) [![Code coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/manager.assets.ubuntu.com/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/canonical-web-and-design/manager.assets.ubuntu.com)

An admin web frontend for managing the [assets-server](https://github.com/canonical-websites/assets.ubuntu.com).

## Local development

First, you need to know the URL of instance of the [assets server](https://github.com/canonical-websites/assets.ubuntu.com) you wish to connect to, and an authorisation key for connecting to it.

### Running the server

The simplest way to run the site locally is to first [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (on Linux you may need to [add your user to the `docker` group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/)), and then use the `./run` script.

The first time you run it, the script will ask you to choose a URL for the server, and an authorisation key. E.g.:

``` bash
$ ./run
```

Set the following variables in your `.env.local`, you might need to ask around for a token.
```
ASSET_SERVER_URL=<url>
ASSET_SERVER_TOKEN=<token>
```
Once the containers are setup, you can visit <http://127.0.0.1:8018> in your browser to see the web frontend for controlling the assets service.

### Building CSS

For working on [Sass files](_sass), you may want to dynamically watch for changes to rebuild the CSS whenever something changes.

To setup the watcher, open a new terminal window and run:

``` bash
./run watch
```

# Deploy
You can find the deployment config in the deploy folder.
